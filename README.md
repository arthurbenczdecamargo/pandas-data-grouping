# Pandas data grouping
**Data science using *Jupyter Notebook* and *Pandas* library.**

## Overview
This project uses *Jupyter Notebook* and *Pandas* to process and analyze data, focusing on grouping, calculating per capita gas emissions, and visualizing the results. The code loads data from Excel files, cleans and processes it, performs grouping operations, and generates visual insights. In addition, it demonstrates how to combine multiple datasets (e.g., gas emissions data and population data) to analyze the correlation between population size and gas emissions across different regions.

## Features
• Load data from Excel files, including emissions data and population data;<br>
• Clean and correct invalid data;<br>
• Group data based on different categories;<br>
• Calculate emissions per capita by merging gas emissions data with population data;<br>
• Create pivot tables to summarize emissions data by year and gas type;<br>
• Visualize the data using subplots and interactive charts with *Plotly*.

## Notes
**This project was made through a course on the [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) website.<br>
The gas emissions data are from the SEEG (Sistema de Estimativas de Emissões de GEE), and the population data are from IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística).**
